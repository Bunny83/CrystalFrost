Recent updates. as of Sept 17, 2022
Textures, sculpts, and meshes are processed by an external thread before being fed into the main thread. This has greatly improved performance.
HOWEVER, the client is eating an inordinate amount of ram to do its thing, and I highly suspect it's the way I'm creating meshes and/or feeding them into the renderer.

# CrystalFrost
Open source Unity 2021.3.6f1 LTS based Second Life viewer using LibreMetaverse.

At current there is no working build, but the source code does work. It lets you log in and renders objects within a 32meter radius around the main camera.

Unless otherwise noted at the top of a given file, the terms of use and redistribution for the source code for this project are that you may download and modify the source for your own personal (but not commercial) use, but may not distribute it without written permission from copyright holder of CrystalFrost, known on Github as JennaScvl, discord as Kallisti#2038, and Second Life as Berry Bunny. I do however welcome submissions and improvements, as well as people who wish to join the team.
